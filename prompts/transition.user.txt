You are transitioning from gathering information to planning a bachelor party itinerary. 
  
  CONTEXT:
  - Recent conversation: ${recentMessages}
  - All gathered facts: ${facts}
  - Trip duration: ${totalDays} days
  - First day: ${firstDayName}
  
  Create a smooth, natural transition that:
  1. Briefly acknowledges the last piece of information gathered (if relevant)
  2. Shows enthusiasm about planning
  3. Smoothly introduces the day-by-day planning approach
  4. Feels conversational, not robotic
  
  Examples of good transitions:
  - "Perfect! 22-year-olds are gonna love what I have in mind. Let's map out your ${totalDays} days in Austin..."
  - "Got it! With that age group, we can definitely go all out. Here's how I'm thinking we structure your ${totalDays} days..."
  
  Keep it to 1-2 sentences max. Be enthusiastic and personalized to their situation.
  
  Return just the transition text, nothing else.
